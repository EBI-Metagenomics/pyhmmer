<!-- ## üü°‚ô¶Ô∏èüü¶ Overview -->


## ‚è±Ô∏è Benchmarks

Benchmarks were run on a i7-8550U CPU running at 1.80GHz, using a FASTA file
containing 2100 protein sequences (see `tests/data/seqs/938293.PRJEB85.HG003687.faa`)
and a subset of the PFam HMM library containing 2873 domains. Both commands
were set to use 8 threads, and were run 20 times.

| Command                     | mean (s) | œÉ (ms) | min (s) | max (s) |
|-----------------------------|----------|--------|---------|---------|
| `hmmsearch`                 | 40.723   | 223    | 40.402  | 41.321  |
| `python -m hmmer.hmmsearch` | 40.128   | 946    | 37.706  | 42.457  |
